4.4BSD-Lite2
============

User-land TCP/IP protocol from 4.4BSD-Lite2, a companion of TCP/IP Illustrated vol. 2.

This is not a fork of https://github.com/sergev/4.4BSD-Lite2, which contains the whole 4.4BSD-Lite2.tar.gz

This repository only contains usr/src/sys of the tarball, ie. the kernel source.

This TCP/IP stack is alive, using tap/tun device.
